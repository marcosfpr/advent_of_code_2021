Here lies my solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), an Advent calendar full of programming puzzles from December 1st all the way to Christmas.

## Inputs and Outputs

All inputs are read from `inputs\inputXX.txt`, with `XX` being the zero-padded day. As per the creator's request, they are not available in this repository and should be downloaded directly from the event website.

## Thanks :-P
